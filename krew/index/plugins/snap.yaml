  shortDescription: Delete half of the pods in a namespace or cluster
  caveats: |
    To reiterate: This will delete half of the pods within the designated space. 

    Currently, if there are pods that have failed or completed, they may get 
    deleted and you may lose debug/log data. 

    Documentation:

      See https://github.com/honk-ci/kubectl-snap or

      $ kubectl snap -h

  description: |
    This plugin will delete half of the pods in a namespace or the whole 
    cluster. It is indiscriminate and may delete all pods under a deployment.

    Restore balance to your cluster at the speed of a snap.
